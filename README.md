Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, classification models were constructed to identify the status of water pumps as being one of three classes: functional, functional but in need of repairs, or completely non-functional. Class labels were predicted based on a number of variables related to the type of pump being operated, when it was installed, who funded it and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
